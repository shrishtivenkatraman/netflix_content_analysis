# Netflix Content Analysis (EDA)

Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix's movies and TV shows dataset using Python.  
The goal is to learn about content trends, genre distribution, and top-producing countries, and practice data handling, visualization, and analytical thinking using the netflix dataset from kaggle. This is an exercise to explore data and the different ways it can be analysed.

Dataset

Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)
